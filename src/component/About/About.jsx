        Soft skills are important for success in the workplace, and video
        analysis is an effective way to evaluate them during the hiring process.
        First, define the skills to be assessed, then design questions or
        scenarios. Record the candidate's responses, analyze the video, and
        provide specific feedback to the hiring manager. Video analysis is
        objective, flexible, and provides a comprehensive view of the
        candidate's communication style and behavior, making it an effective
        tool for predicting success in the workplace.
